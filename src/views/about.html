        <h1>KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ME</h1>

        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Nanbyen Peace Lazwan. I'm a female, dark in complexion, and tall in height. I am Nigerian, from Plateau state, Jos city, and my local government is Langtang North.</p>
        <p>I love God, my parents, and siblings. I also love God-fearing people. I detest people who are dishonest, disloyal, crafty, proud, selfish, envious, jealous, lazy, and dirty.</p>
        <p>I am from a nuclear family and have four siblings: three more girls and a boy. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I am a twin.</p>
        <p>I am also a student at the University of Jos, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Electrical Electronics Engineering. I am presently in 400L and currently undergoing my SIWES (Student Industrial and Workshop Experience Scheme). My SIWES experience is amazing, and I am really learning a lot.</p>
